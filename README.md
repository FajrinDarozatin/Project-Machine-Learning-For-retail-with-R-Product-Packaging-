# Project-Machine-Learning-For-retail-with-R-Product-Packaging-

__Background Project:__

DQLab.id Fashion is a growing fashion store that sells various products such as jeans, shirts, cosmetics, and more. Although sales continue to increase, the growing number of competitors and the accumulation of underperforming products in the warehouse raise concerns for Mr. Agus, the manager of DQLab.id Fashion. These products actually have market potential but have not successfully attracted customer attention.

__Solution:__ 

One solution that can be implemented is to create innovative product packages. By combining less popular products with those that have appeal in certain markets, DQLab.id Fashion can increase sales while optimizing stock. I will assist in identifying attractive product combinations to be packaged using the Apriori algorithm from the arules package in R. This algorithm will help analyze transaction data and find associations between products that can be bundled together to offer appealing promotions.

__Objective:__ 

The objective of this project is to leverage data-driven insights to create product packages that not only help reduce excess stock but also enhance customer satisfaction and retention.

__Tools:__

R, Python
